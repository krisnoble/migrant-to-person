This is a fork of [Cloud to Butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) that aims to humanize [news stories about 'migrants'](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32377768) by making them about 'people' instead. The words used can change the tone of a story dramatically.

Examples
------------
"The 20m (70ft) long boat was believed to be carrying up to 700 migrants" -> "The 20m (70ft) long boat was believed to be carrying up to 700 *people fleeing from a terrible situation*"

"Immigrants are trying to get into the United Kingdom" -> "*People seeking a better life* are trying to get into the United Kingdom"

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag CloudToButt.crx into the page that appears.
